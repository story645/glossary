### important categories (Fong & Spivak, Bradley, Riehl)
- Set: the category of set
- Top: the category of topological spaces (neighborhood)
- Grph: the category of graphs (connection)
- Meas: the category of measure spaces (amount)
- Mon: the category of monoids (action)
- Grp: the category of groups (reversible action, symmetry)
- Cat: the category of categories (action in context, structure)

Bradley
- Set: The objects are sets, the morphisms are functions, and composition is composi-
tion of functions.
- Set∗: The objects are sets S having a distinguished element. (Such sets are called
pointed sets.) A morphism f : S → T is a function satisfying f s0 = t0 whenever s0
is the distinguished element of S and t0 is the distinguished element of T. (Such func-
tions are said to “respect” the distinguished elements.) Composition is composition of
functions.
- Top: The objects are topological spaces, the morphisms are continuous functions, and
composition is composition of functions.
- Top∗: The objects are topological spaces with a distinguished point, often called a
basepoint. (Such spaces are called pointed or based spaces.) The morphisms are
continuous functions that map basepoint to basepoint, and composition is composition
of functions.
- hTop: The objects are topological spaces, the morphisms are homotopy classes of
continuous functions, and composition is composition of these homotopy classes.
- Grp: The objects are groups, the morphisms are group homomorphisms, and compo-
sition is composition of homomorphisms
