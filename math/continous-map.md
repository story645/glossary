### continuous map: 
[[functions]] between [[topological-space|topological spaces]] (wolfram)
- $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous iff the preimage of any [[open-set]] is open
    - $f^{-1}U$ is open in $X$ whenever $U$ is open in Y  
- identity and composition are continuous, and the composition is associative
- topological spaces + continuous functions form a [[categories|category]]
