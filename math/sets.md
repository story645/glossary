# Sets
- cardinality: # of elements in this set
- finite or infinite collection of objects (elements), (grimaldi)
- elements are members of a set (grimaldi)
- order has no significance (wolfram)
- repetition (multiplicity) may or may not be ignored (wolfram)
    - sets w/ repetition are bags and/or multisets
- side note: sets of all sets w/ some constraints (class)
