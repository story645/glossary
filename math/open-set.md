- collection of subsets $\mathcal{B}$ of $X$ is a basis for a [[topological-space|topology]] on $X$ iff:
    - for each $x\in X$ there is $B \in \mathcal{B}$ s.t. $x\in B$
    - $x \in A \cap B$, $A, B \in\mathcal{B}$, at least one $C \in \mathcal{B}$ s.t. $x \in C \subseteq A \cap B$
        - if x is in the intersection of two open sets, x is in the set formed by the intersection of the sets 
    - $\mathscr{T}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is coarsest topology containing $\mathcal{B}$
    - $U \subseteq X$ is open  in $\mathscr{T}$ iff for every $x\in U$, there is a $B \in \mathcal{B}$, s.t. $x \in B \subseteq U$
        - U is open if it contains a smaller open neighborhood that contains x
    - primitive elements that generate everything
open neighborhood (wolfram)
- open neighborhood $U$ of a point x is an open set containing x, $x \in U \subseteq X$
- set of open neighborhoods $U$ = $\mathscr{T}_x$
- related to free groups which are basis for other groups (something w/ minimum constraints)
