### open cover
collection of [[open-set|open-sets]] of a [[topological-space]] whose union contains a given subset 

cover C of a [[sets|set]] X: ([wiki: cover (topology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_(topology)))
- indexed family of sets $U_{\alpha}$ 
- $C = \{U_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\}$ 
- C is a cover of X if $X \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in A} U_{\alpha}$
- in topology, C is a collection of subsets $U_{\alpha}$ of X whose union is the whole space X
