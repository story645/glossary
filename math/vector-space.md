### vector space (Wolfram)
for elements $X,Y, Z \in V$ in vector space $V$ and scalers $r,s \in F$  
- commutativity: X+Y = Y+X
- associativity of vector addition: (X+Y)+Z = X+(Y+Z)
- additive identity: X+0 = X = 0 + X
- additive inverse: X + (-X) = 0
- associativity of scaler multiplication: r(sX) = (rs)X
- distributivity of scaler: (r+s)X = rX + sX
- distributivity of vector: r(X+Y) = rX + rY
- identity multiplication: 1*X = X
