### function (functions between [[sets]]):
- functions: (grimaldi: D5.3)
    - $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a relation in which every element of A appears exactly once as the first component -> (function must be deterministic, each input has one output)
    - image: $(x,y) \in f$, 
        - y is image of x under f
        - x is preimage of y
* domain - input set X
* codomain - set of possible outputs 
* range - set of elements $y \in Y$ that $f(x), x \in X$ maps to
* preimage/inverse: $f^{-1}$- set of elements $x \in X$ that are mapped into a given subset of $y in Y$,
