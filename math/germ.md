### germ [Harder]
a germ of a continuous function at p is a continuous function $f:U_p \rightarrow C$ defined in an open neighborhood $U_p$ modulo $f:U_p \rightarrow C) \equiv (g: V_p \rightarrow C)$
iff  $W_p \subset U_p \cap V_p$ s.t. $f|W_p = g|W_p$

a germ is a section of a sheaf, function into a [[stalk]]
