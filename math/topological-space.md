### topological-space $(X,\mathscr{T})$ (Bradley)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdOaMOcxY7U
- set $X$ and a topology $\mathscr{T}$ 
- topology $\mathscr{T}$ on $X$ is a collection of [[open-set|open sets]] of $X$ that satisfy the following properties: 
    - empty set $\varnothing$ and $X$ are in $\mathscr{T}$ 
    - union of elements in $\mathscr{T}$ are also in $\mathscr{T}$ 
    - any finite intersection of elements in $\mathscr{T}$ is also in $\mathscr{T}$ 
- notation: $X$ <=> $(X,\mathscr{T})$ when topology is understood
- a topology - axiomatic way to construct topological space
