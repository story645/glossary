### contractable space 

space w/ the [[homotopy|homotopy-type]] of a point (hatcher)

a [[topological-space]] X is contractable if the identity map is homotopic to a constant map of X to itself (nullhomotopic). (Spanier, Hatcher)

contraction of $X$ to $x_O$ is a homotopy from $1_x$ to the constant map $x_0 \in X$

- contractable space is a space that can be continuously shrunk to a point within that space (wiki)
