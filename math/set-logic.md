### operations on [[sets]]
Given $A, B \subset U$: 
- union: elements in A or B
- intersection: elements in A and B
- difference: elements in A not in B 

- disjoint set: two sets w/ no elements in common $A \cap B = \varnothing$
- disjoint union $A\sqcup B$
    - retains original set membership (usually via an index key)
  - $A \sqcup B = (A\times\{0\}) \cup (B\times \{1\})$
