### simplicial complex (Spanier)
Simplicial complex K consists of 
- [[set]] $\{v\}$ of vertices $v$
- set $\{s\}$ of finite non-empty subsets of $\{v\}$ called simplexes s.t.
  - a) any set consisting of exactly one vertex is a simplexes
  - b) any nonempty subset of a simplex is a simplex

simplex: generalized triangle
    - 0D vertices
    - 1D edges
    - 2D faces
    - 3D solids
    - 4D spaces between solids?
k-simplex
    - k + 1 vertices
    - spaces between them (convex hull)
  
complete graph on k vertices = (k-1) simplex

simplacial complex is set of simplicies considered one unit 
    - can be individual/independent 
    - if stuck together, must be along whole vertex, edge, face, etc.
