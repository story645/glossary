## cartesian cats
### cartesian monoidal category
* obj A in A and B in B, A\times B = C in C,
  * can identify an object in the category that is the product 
  * can multiply objects to get another object in the category 
* category in which the monoid is a product 
  * [[monoids|monoidal]] category where the object is a product?

* graph \times graph = graph 
  * multiplication is AND - ordered pairs 
  * sum is OR - disjoint union/all seperate

### bicartesian category 
C and C^{op} are both cartesian
### semi-cartesian monoidal category
monoidal category w/ projection:

### cartesian closed category
Cartesian category  w/ right adjoint functor (where right adjoint is a kind of inverse)
- cartesian category: initial + terminal objects
