### Yoneda Lemma 
Mac Lane
- [[functors|functor]] $K:D \rightarrow \textbf{Set}$
- [[categories|object]] $r \in D$
- [[contravariant-functors|covaraint]] [[hom-set|hom functor]] $D(r,-)$  
- [[function-types|bijection]] $y: Nat(D(r,-),K)\cong K$ which sends each [[natural-transformation]] $\alpha: D(r,-)\rightarrow K$ to $\alpha_r, 1_r$ , the image of identity $r \rightarrow r$. 
 

notes: 
objects are completely determined by their relationships to w/ other objects (Bradley)
instead of object w/ parts inside, model the object via the arrows in and out of it, how the object transforms tells you what you need to know about the artist, ways that integers can go to themselves -> all determined my the functions...
