### retraction and deformation (Spanier)

- the [[topological-space]]$A \subset X$ is a retract of $X$ iff there is a [[continous-map]] $r:X \rightarrow A$ such that $r(x) = x$ for all $x\in A$
- r is called the retraction
  
- A space $X$ is deformable into a subspace A iff the inclusion map $i: A\subset X$ has a right [[homotopy]] [[inverse]]

lemma: if X is deformable into a retract A, then A is a deformation retract of X

deformation retraction (hatcher)
space X into subspace A, family of maps $f_t: X \rightarrow X, t \in I$ s.t $f_0 = \mathit{1}$  $f_1(X) = A$ and $f_t|A = \mathit{1}$, where $\mathit{1}$ is the identity map and I is the unit interval [0,1]
