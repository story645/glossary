### Glyphs
any discrete piece of visual information that can be differentiated from other elements of the visual field - kosara and Zeminsky

Notational characters (Lee, Goodman):
1. symbols that form equivalence classes which can be exchanged without syntactical effect
2. characters have to be 'fintely differentiable' 

In the context of data visualization, a glyph is the visual representation of a piece of data where the attributes of a graphical entity are dictated by one or more attributes of a data record. (Ward, Munzner)
